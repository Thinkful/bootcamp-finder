Byte Academy in New York City teaches FinTech, data science, and MedTech in a
three-month bootcamp. Starting in about the ninth week of the intensive,
students begin preparing for job interviews and are introduced to
representatives of companies interested in hiring Byte Academy graduates. No
previous programming experience is necessary, as students will learn all of
the basics in a virtual (part-time) pre-bootcamp curriculum.
