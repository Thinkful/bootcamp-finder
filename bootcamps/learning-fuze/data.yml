      or remotely. A curriculum designed to make students development and employment ready 
      
      based on the full immersion program. 
      
      
      The Part-Time Comprehensive program is tailored to students who are looking for a part 
      
      time alternative to the full immersion program, and is designed to deliver the same 
      
      content and intensity of the full immersion program, but with the flexibility to take
      
      the program over time, in steps or “modules” based on their schedule. Additionally, 
      
      students looking for skills and knowledge in a particular technical area but not necessarily
      
      all 5 modules can simply choose to take an individual module of their choice rather than
      
      each module sequentially. Students can also choose to specific modules or "Tracks" related
      
      to Front End Development (Modules 1, 2 and 3), Back End Development (1, 2 and 4) or
      
      Full Stack (1, 2, 3 and 4). The 5th module is optional for those students looking for 
      
      career services. 
      
      
      Simply apply and ensure you are ready to get the most out of the instruction. Of course,
      
      whether taking an individual module or two or working through all of the modules, the 
      
      program is all about the practical skills of development by building numerous full scale
      
      projects in a work like environment led by seasoned instructors!
