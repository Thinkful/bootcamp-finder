DevMountain's mission is to deliver the most impactful coding education
in a way that is both accessible and affordable. A small percentage of
people can afford to quit their jobs for three months, relocate to another
state, and pay huge sums of money in order to learn to code. That's why
the majority of DevMountain's courses are offered in an after-hours format
so that students can maintain a full-time job while attending. They also
have full-time courses as well, in order to meet the needs of some of
learners who want to go all-in on programming in an immersive environment.

DevMountain offers courses in both Web Development and iOS Development.
Their Web Development course focuses on Javascript as well as HTML, CSS, jQuery,
AngularJS, Node.js, Firebase, MySQL, Mongodb, and more. Their iOS course
curriculum is written and taught by iOS developers with their students usually
progressing far enough to have multiple apps in the store by the end of class.

All DevMountain instructors and mentors also work full-time as developers and
are always up to date with the latest trends and technologies. Each
DevMountain student is assigned a mentor who they can contact at any time to
get help both in and out of class. Mentors have weekly code reviews with
students to help them improve and to give them valuable career advice.
