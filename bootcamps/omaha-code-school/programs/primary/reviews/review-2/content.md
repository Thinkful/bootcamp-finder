The school’s philosophy encourages people of all learning styles to work in
whatever environment fits them best: even if that means heading to a coffee
shop down the street. At the forefront of that philosophy is Sumeet, whose
knowledge, humor and transparency keeps the learning seriously fulfilling.
We’ve placed our trust in him. We’ve quit jobs, stepped away from career
paths. One of our classmates moved halfway across the country from New York.
Sumeet’s striving to be “always on,” to never gloss over a concept just
because it would be easier for him as a teacher: That’s part of what steels me
to be on time and to pay attention. It is a marked difference from college,
for sure. There is no attendance policy, no requirement to participate, no
grades. And yet, I haven’t considered missing a day of class. I’ve felt
comfortable asking questions when they come to me, which I couldn’t say was
the same in my journalism classes. And I’ve worked harder on homework than
ever before, even though there’s no hardline obligation to finish it: I feel
the drive to understand the lectures and put their lessons to practice. All in
all, it’s been a wonderful first quarter (almost). Now let’s see just how far
we’ll have come around this time next week. Meet you back here.
