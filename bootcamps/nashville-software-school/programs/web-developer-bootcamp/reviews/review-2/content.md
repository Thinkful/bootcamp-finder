One year ago I began one of the hardest, but most enjoyable 6 months of my
life. I began the NSS Software Development Bootcamp and put myself on the path
to a new career as a coder. I went from a forty-something guy with an
increasingly outdated set of professional tools to having the skills I needed
to enter the cutting-edge field of software development. While I searched for
the perfect opportunity after completing the program, I gave back to the
school in small measure by helping organize a fund raiser, and by doing some
coding for this site. That led to an opportunity to be a teaching assistant
for the latest Booctamp cohort that got underway this month. It’s been a great
experience helping the new students absorb the vast amount of information that
comes their way every day. Being a TA has also served as a measure of how far
I’ve come since my first few weeks as a Bootcamp student, and as a reminder of
how much more I can learn every day for the rest of my career. My time as a TA
will most likely be short; I’m interviewing for developer jobs as we speak.
But while I’m here, I’m grateful for the opportunity to help make NSS a great
place to change your life. - Joe S.
