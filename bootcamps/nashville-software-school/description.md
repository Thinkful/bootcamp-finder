Nashville Software School more so than many other bootcamps is all about
community. Not just the tech community, but the Nashville tech community. This
bootcamp is actually a community funded non-profit. Prior to 2014, the
bootcamp was only available to Nashville residents, so expect to see a lot of
local flavor, from the students in attendance to their hiring partners.

The school currently operates two bootcamps: one for Web Development
Foundations and one for Software Development Foundations (centered around Ruby
on Rails). Both are open to beginners. They break up their teachings into
three main categories. You will receive intensive training through online
tutorials, videos, classroom lectures, pair programming, solo programing,
group programming and seminar discussions. Throughout this intensive training
you will also receive mentorship from their staff. Finally, you will also be
set up with apprenticeships. They work with a number of partner companies to
provide you with internships and projects to get hands on experience.

Applying is super straight forward. Fill out the application online, and if
they are interested they will schedule a video or in-person interview. Expect
to hear back about if you got an interview within a week and to have the
actual interview 2-3 weeks after sending in your application. Also good to
note is that they include a long list of qualification or things they want to
see in their applicants on their apply page.
