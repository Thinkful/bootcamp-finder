Wyncode’s 12-week bootcamp, in South Florida, readies students for careers as
Ruby and JavaScript developers. Part of the program also involves community
service, where Wyncode students go to local elementary schools to teach
disadvantaged children how to code. Wyncode students will build web apps, and
show them to hundreds of people – including potential employers – during the
bootcamp’s Pitch Day.
