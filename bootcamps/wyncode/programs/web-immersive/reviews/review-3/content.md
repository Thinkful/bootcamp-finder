I came into Wyncode with no coding experience at all. I had completed some
basic codecademy courses on (HTML, CSS, and Ruby) but apart from that, I had
never written an actual line of code. Through 9 weeks of Wyncode I was able to
develop skills in HTML, CSS, Ruby on Rails, Git, Javascript, Jquery. During
Wyncode I was able to build several websites, half a dozen web apps, and our
own API that was later released on Mashape. Another critical skill that was
taught in Wyncode is using Git and Github properly, something that is used
throughout every branch of coding and is a must for anyone wanting to work as
a web developer. Wyncode doesn't end when you complete the course. Its a
community that is always there to help you obtain your dream job or continue
your education. After completing Wyncode , I kept exploring new languages and
frameworks. Since graduating, I have added rubymotion and objective-c to my
skills as well as successfully built and deployed an iOS app to the Apple
AppStore, and It all started with a visit to Wyncode. Wyncode is composed of a
dedicated group of people who will give you everything you need to succeed in
tech, all you need to put in is the hard work. Its an intensive coding
bootcamp that delivers results. - Alfonso
