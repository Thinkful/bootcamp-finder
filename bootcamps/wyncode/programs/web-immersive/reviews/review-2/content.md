I entered Wyncode hoping to learn to code, and got so much more than that. I
left feeling empowered and able to not only build whatever I wanted, but to
take myself seriously as a leader and entrepreneur. Located at the LAB,
Wyncode is in the heart of Miami's startup scene and there were always
exciting events happening around us. The program is quick to adapt to student
feedback, and it is all driven by a fantastic core leadership team. Jo and
Juha are personally invested in each student, and Ed can teach like it's
nobody's business. In the nine months since i've graduated, I've watched my
peers get amazing positions and pursue really cool opportunities. For a solid
education in coding, a crash course in entrepreneurship, and a vehicle for
integrating yourself into the Miami Tech community, there is no option other
than Wyncode. - Walter Latimer
