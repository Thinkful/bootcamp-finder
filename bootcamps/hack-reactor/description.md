Hack Reactor wants to turn you into a software engineer by teaching you CS
fundamentals, full-stack JavaScript and engineering best practices. Through
lectures, toy problems and large projects, students learn cutting edge
technologies, and become adept at teaching themselves new languages, libraries
and frameworks. Students pair program for much of the course, allowing them to
learn from one another and fostering crucial communication skills. There are
also fun activities that happen in the evening like meetups and guest
speakers.

At a macro level, you will spend the first six weeks learning basic skills and
learning the mindset of engineers. The next six weeks are devoted to
completing a personal project, a short group project and a large group
project, giving you experience programming like you would at a developer job.
At the end of the program, there is a demo day to show off your projects to
potential employers.

While a coding background isn't a requirement, requires you to complete an
admissions coding challenge and a technical interview.
