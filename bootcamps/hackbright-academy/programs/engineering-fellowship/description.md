All types of engineering fields are traditionally male-dominated, so 
Hackbright Academy in San Francisco is a 12-week all women's bootcamp. The 
program says they graduate more female software engineers each year than both 
Stanford and the University of California at Berkeley. One of the features of 
Hackbright Academyâ€™s program is that students are given the opportunity to 
speed-interview with tech companies at the end of the program.
