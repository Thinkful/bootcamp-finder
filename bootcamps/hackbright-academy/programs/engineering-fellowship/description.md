All types of engineering fields are traditionally male-dominated, so
Hackbright Academy in San Francisco is a 10-week all-women’s bootcamp. The
program says they graduate more female software engineers each year than both
Stanford and the University of California at Berkeley. One of the features of
Hackbright Academy’s program is a Career Day where soon-to-be graduates have
an opportunity to interview with more than 20 tech companies.
