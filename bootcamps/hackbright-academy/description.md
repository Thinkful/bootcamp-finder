Hackbright is a bootcamp that focuses on teaching Python and only accepts 
women into their cohorts. It's a double whammy of uniqueness in coding 
bootcamps. Their goal is to increase female representation in tech through 
education, mentorship, and community.

Hackbright aims to provide a curated subset of classic undergraduate computer 
science offerings, combined with hands-on teaching of concepts relevant for 
modern web application development. As part of this accelerated experience, you 
should expect to spend a lot of time pair programming. Students are given the 
opportunity to speed-interview with tech companies at the end of the program. 

Hackbright has a unique mentorship program for all of their fellowship 
students. You will be matched up with at least 2 mentors who are software 
engineers from leading companies in the industry such as Amazon, Eventbrite, 
Uber, Slack, New Relic, and more.

To apply, you need to create an account on their site and complete an 
application and coding challenge. Just make sure to reserve time for it.
