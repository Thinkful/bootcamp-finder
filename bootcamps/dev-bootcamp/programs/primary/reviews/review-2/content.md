I was having a hard time getting a firm grasp on programming on my own, but
knew it was something I wanted to do. Dev Bootcamp seemed to be exactly what I
needed - a passionate, collaborative environment that focused on learning by
doing. I was also hoping to leverage this experience to live/work abroad. The
program far exceeded my expectations. A few months later, I find myself in
Paris, starting my first job as a web developer with a great team, more
excited than ever about what's to come. I love this stuff. - Mack M.
