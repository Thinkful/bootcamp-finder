The excellent teachers and supportive learning environment enabled me to
really learn a lot. I learned a lot about myself and how I learn, as well as
how to build and architect systems and use ruby/ ruby on rails as a means of
creating beautiful and meaningful web applications. It was also great to help
others get through the program and watch as they progressed in skill.
Programming boot camps are beginning to become very trendy so if you are even
thinking of doing DBC make sure to apply now, since the waiting list is
several months long already. The wait list at DBC chicago is shorter than DBC
San Fran. My only critique with the program is with their philosophy that by
the end of the program you are a "world class beginner". Not to be cocky but
my advice to you is to remove the word "beginner" or "junior" from your
vocabulary/ any of your online profiles, especially when interviewing. Â After
graduating from DBC I feel more than confident that I can take on any software
engineering challenge I am presented with and solve it like any other good
engineer. - Ty K.
