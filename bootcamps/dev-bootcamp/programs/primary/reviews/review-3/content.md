I don't think it's possible to learn on one's own what I learned at Dev
Bootcamp, regardless of the time spent. Dev Bootcamp's emphasis on
collaborative projects and paired programming have given me skills that are
invaluable in the workplace: I know what it takes to meet a ship date, how to
code alongside another person, and collaborate with a team of developers
possessing a diverse set of skills and backgrounds. My code improved
tremendously at Dev Bootcamp, but these latter skills will make all the
difference wherever I go next. - Jeff S.
