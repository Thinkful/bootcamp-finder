No experience is necessary to enlist in Dev Bootcamp’s nine-week intensive
program, which includes 80+ hours of weekly studies and hands-on coding
projects. The bootcamp also includes one week of career prep, and nine more
weeks of part-time studies (that segment of the program can be completed
remotely.) Dev Bootcamp graduates have landed jobs as junior developers at an
array of small, medium, and giant companies – including Apple and Twitter.
