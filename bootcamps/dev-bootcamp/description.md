If you are accepted into Dev Bootcamp, you will definitely be prepared. They
have two phases of preparation. Prep and Phase 0. Phase 0 is a 9 week phase
requiring about 15-20 hours of work a week. During this phase, you will be
working with teachers via video chats and programming with other students from
your class. It should feel a lot like Dev Bootcamp, but remote.
In addition to this, they offer prep material for students who want to do
preparation before Phase 0. You can take a look at some of that prep work
here.

Aside from the prep work, once you get on-site, Dev Bootcamp practices a
flipped classroom. A traditional classroom experience is structured so you
learn skills in a group and then get hands on practice as an individual. At
Dev Bootcamp, you learn individually through videos and tutorials and then
practice the skills you learned in group projects.

Applications are accepted on a rolling basis. You will need to create an
account to apply.
