I’ve designed many websites over the years while working in the previously
mentioned fields but was always hitting a wall when my skills couldn’t match
my vision. I learned about CodeCore through my brother in law (who happens to
be a teacher at CodeCore!) and was very interested in the idea of “jump
starting” my learning. Anyone that is ready and committed to learning more
[should join CodeCore]. From my experience CodeCore will open you up to the
world of coding and the possibilities that brings. - Jef
