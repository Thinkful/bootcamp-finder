CodeCore's Bootcamp Program culminates in their hiring day, and you can see
this focus throughout the bootcamp. You should expect to be doing a lot of
pair programming to get you
building real world projects quickly. On Hiring Day, CodeCore's employer
partnership network comes to view the projects you created and potentially
extend job offers. While they don't guarantee that you will get a job, they do
boast that they have a network of 20 hiring partners.

They host four bootcamps a year and cover a different topic each time. While
you might see a number of the languages we listed below being taught again,
don't be surprised if new languages are added or switched out by the time you
want to apply. In the past, they have run bootcamps on Python, PHP, Java and
.NET. While the languages and topics of their bootcamp change, CodeCore's
fundamental teaching philosophy does not. They teach you a primary language
and then provide supplementary languages, skill sets and libraries to provide
you a practical understanding of the core language.

As a case in point, their current Ruby Bootcamp doesn't stop at teaching you
Ruby on Rails, but also provides a background knowledge of Front End languages
and Development methodologies. It is probably reasonable to guess that while
the languages may change, skills taught such as popular
APIs, User Experience (UX) and agile development methodologies will
remain somewhat constant.

They have a great comprehensive application process. You will need to apply on
their site, have a quick get to know you coffee or phone call, and have a more
intensive in person or Skype testing session. Oh, and don't worry about moving
to Canada, they have partnerships with extended stay hotels in the area so you
get discounted accommodations.
