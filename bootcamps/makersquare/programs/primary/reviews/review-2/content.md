I came in knowing basically nothing and gained a really strong foundation in
programming... So much so, that I managed to land a Javascript/C#
apprenticeship 8.5 weeks (out of 10) after writing my first line of RUBY.
Everything you learn in this program can be applied to writing other languages
and is a great stepping stone for self-led instruction when the program ends.
The instructors are amazing and so so helpful, I would recommend this program
to anyone who has been let down by online tutorials and really wants to land a
job as a developer. - Taylor D.
