I was impressed MakerSquare took a different approach. It breaks the mold in
that way and that drew me in. The team here is so committed to adapting and
improving, asking for our feedback every day. They act quickly making changes
to curriculum and lessons are revised each cohort. MakerSquare itself is a
great example of how to build an awesome culture and a successful business.
They work hard to incorporate fun, variety, freedom, and teamwork â€“ values
that I have when working in any environment. When we leave here, we will be
looking to join companies with an awesome work environment and culture, even
starting those ourselves. MakerSquare is the perfect model for us. - Kelley R.
