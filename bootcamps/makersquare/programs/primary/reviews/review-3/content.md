My first day, I was introduced to 60 new people–and as the entire class can
attest, I didn’t know any of their names. By Tuesday morning, I knew all of
them (their names at least), and I am making a conscious effort to learn each
of their stories. I’m blown away by the feeling I get being in a room full of
people with the enthusiasm, determination, and mental dexterity to try new
things. Despite the unspoken fact that we’re all vying for a finite number of
jobs in the Boston startup community, not one person has any interest in
playing dirty. Instead, we’re relying on each other–sharing skills, offering
advice, making connections, and forging friendships. - Adam S.
