At MakerSquare, you will be learning using a huge variety of methods including
project work, group work, individual work, one-on-one time with instructors,
mentorships, presentations, demos, hackathons, etc. A lot of these sessions
are meant to be fun from Demo's and Drinks to show hackathon projects to your
fellow classmates to MakerStories where prominent members of the tech
community stop by and share their experiences. Don't worry, some of these
events will be structured around finding you a job after the program, like the
Career Day which is attended by MakerSquare's hiring partners.

You will also be well prepared to get on your way. You will learn basic HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript in their preparation work to be complete before day one of
class. Once you have begun you will learn Angular, Meteor, NodeJS and Express.

Applying involes an online application, a 30 minute Skype interview, a 30
minute technical interview and a secondary application. In total, it should
take you about 3 weeks from start to finish to find out if you were accepted.

Also make sure to check out their DevHouse if you are applying from out of
town. It's a house just for MakerSquare students!
