The 16 Week Immersive Bootcamp + Elective track is for the bold. Throughout the 16 Week Immersive Bootcamp students train to become software engineers by learning full-stack development and a specific elective offered during that course. The course's web development curriculum covers basic front-end, advanced front-end, JavaScript and the MEAN stack, and Python and PostgreSQL. During the evenings, students will complete a 5 to 6 week elective covering either UI/UX Design, Cross-Platform Mobile App Development, or iOS App Development from an industry expert.

In addition to becoming a software engineer, each student will complete a series of career training exercises, including, but not limited to resume guidance, mock interview training, portfolio development, and gain access to DigitalCrafts growing network of hiring partners.
