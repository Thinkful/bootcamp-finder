The point of Starter School is to give you a taste of the full spectrum of
building a software product. Other bootcamps and software development schools
do a great job of making you into a developer, but you don’t always see the
bigger picture. Even if you do specialize in just one area, be it programming
or design, it is so valuable to be able to speak the other person’s language,
or even get your hands dirty with another area of the product.

Starter School brings you the best people in their fields to teach, but the
way each of them build products is very different. Over the past nine months,
I’ve learned how to develop a lens through which I can look at conflicting
advice objectively, and make a decision on what I think will best move my
project forward.

Not only was what I learned incredibly valuable for anyone looking to start a
career in software, but learning them as a nineteen year old college dropout
changed my life. I’m already building a portfolio of freelance work. I have no
regrets about leaving college to go to Starter School. I’m just excited for
the future. [\- Garrett](http://www.garrettqmartin.com/blog/2014/07/15/my-
