Full Stack Academy’s three-month bootcamp, held in New York City, guarantees
that students will create at least three full-featured web apps (using
JavaScript for starters) during their intensives. Students can also show their
apps to prospective employers during a “Hiring Day” event. At least 97% of
Full Stack Academy graduates find jobs as software engineers.
