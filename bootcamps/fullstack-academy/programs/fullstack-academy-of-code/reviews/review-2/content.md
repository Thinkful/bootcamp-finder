  

I really enjoyed my FSA experience. I wished it were longer, more than 13
weeks. I realized there are lots of stuff that I wished we could cover such as
security, file streaming, webRTC. I wished it could be longer with more
materials. Nevertheless, I was surprised by the fact that a 13 week course
would be able to change my life in a meaningful way.

  

Job prospects are definitely bright. With AngularJS, a hot technology for many
employers now, I believe that FSA students will have no trouble finding their
first job as a web developer, although this entirely depends on each
individual. FSA doesn’t give out certificates or degrees, but skills and
networks. I think it is each student’s responsibility to maximize what FSA
gives to him or her. Those who sacrifice time and energy the most and reach
out the most will learn the most, and will get the most job interviews and
will get the better job offers.

  

FSA didn’t only give me skills and networks, but changed my life in a
meaningful way. I felt that I have found a hobby that can make a living for
myself (programming is really fun!). In fact, FSA made me consider of pursuing
further study in Computer Science. I think for a few years, programming
bootcamps such as FSA will thrive over traditional education. However, further
down the road, maybe traditional education will catch up, or probably be
merged with bootcamps and transform into something different.
