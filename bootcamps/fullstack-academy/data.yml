description: "Not surprisingly, Fullstack Academy does exactly what it says it does.\
  \ It teaches you the full web development stack. This means that you will learn\
  \ how to program the Front End (the website your user would interact with) and\
  \ the Back End (the piece on the server which performs all the logic for your site),\
  \ specifically NERDS stack and everything in between (\u221E). Ok, they don't actually\
  \ teach you an infinite amount of knowledge, but it is more comprehensive coverage\
  \ of material than you might see at other bootcamps.\n\nThey are also comprehensive\
  \ in structure. Before you arrive, expect to do a significant ammount of pre-work\
  \ that helps effectively prepare you for the course. After the bootcamp, expect\
  \ support to help you find a job including mock technical interviews.  While\
  \ Fullstack's curriculum is certainly comprehensive when it comes to programming,\
  \ what is even more impressive is the integration of intangible skills throughout\
  \ the course. As part of the learning experience, Fullstack encourages its students\
  \ to take advantage of the growing New York tech scene and attend the numerous\
  \ MeetUps and Hackathons that take place. Outside of just New York, they also encourage\
  \ their students to take part in Open Source projects (often a source of pride\
  \ and credentials for programmers).\n\nThe most obvious way these skills are infused\
  \ into the course is through the CTO Program, a series of  modules that teach\
  \ essential CTO skills, and to which students gain access at the end of the program.\
  \ These modules include lessons like\
  \ Learning to Learn, Learning to Lead, Learning by Teaching, Become the Right Person,\
  \ Real World Experience, Code is a Community, Innovation Happens Everywhere, and\
  \ Stackup Support.\n\nThey accept applications online on their site on a rolling\
  \ basis, but expect to wait up to a week to hear back if you got an interview or\
  \ not. Prior to the interview, they will provide additional materials to help you\
  \ prepare as well as several take-home problem sets. Fullstack Academy currently\
  \ reports a hiring rate of over 80% for their students and they take pride in\
  \ their job placement process.\n\n"
