After five weeks of at-home prework, students complete Actualize’s 12-week part-time in-class training program to learn full-stack web development. Then, each graduate has the opportunity to join digital consultancy The Difference Engine part-time for up to four months to hone the skills and gain the experience that employers are looking for now. Actualize’s schedule (Sundays 9a-5p and Mon-Thurs 6-9:30p) allows students to keep their full-time jobs throughout the course and apprenticeship.
