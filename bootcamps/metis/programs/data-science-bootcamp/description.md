Metis data science bootcampers will leave fully qualified for entry-level jobs
as data scientists. Career networking, preparation, and support begins from
the first day of bootcamp; alumni can also continue to take advantage of
special networking opportunities while working part-time as data science
consultants. Metis graduates have landed data scientist jobs at dozens of
companies including Columbia Law School, Etsy, and Kaplan.
