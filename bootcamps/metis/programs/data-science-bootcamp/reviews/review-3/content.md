Days 3, 4, and 5 flew by at Metis. We worked on new concepts and we were
introduced to OOP (Object-oriented Programming). This is usually where I have,
in the past with different languages, gotten either frustrated because I
didn't understand, or just got lazy and started copying and pasting, and,
therefore, stopped learning. This time, however, everything seems different. I
am having more and more "Aha!" moments than ever before. Those moments
motivate me more than anything when I am are struggling to understand certain
new concepts. I have hit a couple of walls in the last few days, but have been
successful at climbing over each and every one. On Friday, we had two great
talks by the developers at thoughtbot. Someone asked a great question about
using github to show our very rusty, and easily indentifiable as novice, code
on public repos in case someone in the future sees how poorly we wrote code.
Chris Toomey, developer @ thoughtbot, had a great answer. He explained that it
is much more valuable to have a history of how you have progressed as a
developer in such a short amount of time, than to have no history at all. I
was in total agreement. I had already been pushing all my code for week 1 of
the bootcamp, and will continue to as the bootcamp progresses. Not only for
others to see my progression, but to prove to myself that all these things
that seem impossibly difficult to achieve now, will seem like small pebbles in
the road 6 months from now. - Justin K.
