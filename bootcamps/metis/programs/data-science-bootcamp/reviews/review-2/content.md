Metis has provided me with the opportunity to satiate my programming needs,
and much, much more. I am so thrilled to finally be able to pursue my dream. I
didn't know what I wanted to be until I actually became it -- a developer --
and I am beyond excited to continue to expand my knowledge and skillset, with
the help of the amazing instructors at Metis, and my fellow students. - Alex
