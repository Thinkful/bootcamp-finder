I can tell you, without a doubt and with no exaggeration, that I have learned
more things about web development and Ruby on Rails in 3 weeks than I could
have possibly anticipated. Something about the pace and challenges are just
perfectly pitched to teach us as much as possible without overwhelming us.
I’ve built 4 Rails applications on my own, before Metis, and every day I learn
things that make me cringe at my previous code. I feel honored and humbled to
be here learning from some of the best Rails developers in the world, and I
have absolutely no doubt that I will be completely job ready at the end of
these 12 weeks. I am so impressed with what I’ve already learned so far and am
excited to imagine where I will be when I graduate. I made a great decision,
and I hope you do too. - Jesse W.
