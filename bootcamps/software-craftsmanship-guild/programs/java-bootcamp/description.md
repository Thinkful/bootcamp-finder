Both the .Net and Java bootcamps are based on the premise of the Software
Craftsmanship Guild FIRM learning Model. F represents foundation meaning you
don't need to have any experience. Moreover, they will provide you with a
solid foundation to build your skills round. Think getting back to the basics
and understanding the principles behind coding and software design. I
represents immersion. AKA, expect to code. Alot. You will learn to code via a
number of different methods from individual learning to team exercises. R
represents reinforcement. See above just over and over again. Sorry, didn't
mean to be dreary, but repetition is often the way to become truly successful.
(Think about the 10,000 hour rule). Don't worry, they do spice things up with
coding quizzes and team projects.M represents Mastery. They want to provide
support for you after you finish the bootcamp and continue to grow as a
software developer including networking.
