Almost right away, I knew I had made the right decision to join the Guild. Our
class had seven people, so it was a very intimate environment conducive to
learning. Eric had us writing basic programs using loops and if statements
before the end of Day 1, and I was starting on a Tic Tac Toe console app by
Day 3. Although formal class hours were between 9 am and 4 pm, Eric was always
available via Skype to answer questions and help me debug in the evenings.
When I had to miss a couple days to go out of town for responsibilities with
my startup, Eric made sure I was caught up. Of course, there were struggles
too. We moved very quickly through the course material, which made it
stressful to try and keep up. Some days, it felt like Eric was so busy
teaching us something new that he didn’t even notice that we didn’t understand
the previous concept. There were big differences between the skill levels of
all the students, which made it difficult to gauge how we were doing. As soon
as some of us gave feedback to Eric, he changed his approach immediately. He
started giving us more time to work on our capstone projects at our own pace.
He became more aware of our individual abilities and gave us more one-on-one
mentorship. I am confident that the hiccups in curriculum flow will have been
resolved by the time the September class comes in. Eric has learned a great
deal from teaching us, and I’m almost envious that the next class gets to reap
all the benefits. - Eden F.
