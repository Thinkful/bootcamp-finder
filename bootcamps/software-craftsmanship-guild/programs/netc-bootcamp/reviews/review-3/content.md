Eric Wise’s full stack knowledge of C#, Object Oriented Programming and
ancillary web technologies is immense. If you have some tangential question
about a technology that doesn't happen to be in his arsenal, or that has faded
from his memory through lack of recent exposure, he will get up to speed
almost immediately. He will often research it right there in class and be able
to present the material within the hour. That said, he is still figuring out
how to adapt to different learning styles. There were times I was very
frustrated and felt he was going too fast - piling more and more information
on top of us. Partly that is just how it goes in a boot camp. I was surprised
when topics that were inaccessible to me at the time they were presented
magically opened weeks later. Eric is invested in your success. He spends
every hour of class (35 hours a week) with his students. He is available at
all hours to take questions via skype or email. Believe him when he says you
can ask him the same stuff again and again.. Overall I like him a lot.
Sometimes I’d get mad at him for shoving me forward when I wasn’t ready to go,
or giving me an answer that obliterated the set up of my question. Oh well. He
is good at explaining things -but if you are not getting it you have to ask
him to try again. The more you ask him, the more feedback he gets from you,
the more you email him, the more you skype him questions, the happier he will
be... And the more you will learn. - Naomi H.
