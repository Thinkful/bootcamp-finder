HackerYou interested me for several reasons. First, they offer a very non-
traditional classroom, where instead of competing amongst ourselves, we are
encouraged to work together to become better developers. There are no grades,
and the feeling is that since we’re not getting a degree, the course will only
be beneficial if we decide to put in the time and the effort to learn
something. I’m finding that this change in how I am motivated is really
helping me to focus and to learn! I also appreciate the diversity of the
students in the HackerYou course. People are coming from a pretty wide variety
of backgrounds in terms of their previous careers, their ages, where they are
from, etc. and it helps us move forward as we can teach each other from our
own background...It’s nice when you can tell that your experience in the
course is just as important to them as it is to you - everyone has been so
helpful so far, and I’m really happy that I chose to take this course. [ \-
