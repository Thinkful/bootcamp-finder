At this nine-week bootcamp, you’ll learn HTML5, CSS3, responsive design,
design theory, jQuery, JavaScript and WordPress, plus all of the skills you
need to run your own freelance business. To create the curriculum, the
HackerYou team collaborated with developer Ahmed Omran. In addition to his
developer background, he has a great background in education and
documented the thought that went into designing the HackerYou educational
experience.

The program runs for nine weeks, during which you’ll be at HackerYou HQ five
days a week from about 10 am to 6 pm. The program has over 360 hours of class
time where you will learn through hundreds of exercises, a major project
assignment each week and an educational thread focused on helping you to
develop the skills you’ll need to succeed as a freelancer. You will also get
great personal attention. There are three instructors per course and a cap of
25 students.

The application process begins with an online application. Next, you can
expect an in-person or Skype video interview with Heather Payne, HackerYou's
founder and CEO. She'll chat with you to determine if HackerYou is a mutual
fit. Next, you'll receive some case study questions meant to highlight the
realities of life as a freelancer. Once returned, the HackerYou team will
discuss your application and decide as a team to offer you a conditional
acceptance. The acceptance becomes official upon your completion of the pre-
course work and submitting a three-item portfolio of websites you've built.

HackerYou was founded by the team who introduced Ladies Learning
Code in 2011, and to date it is the only
programming bootcamp in existence founded and run by women. So, although it's
co-ed, typically 70% of students are female. It's a great bootcamp for those
who appreciate diversity and are looking for a social and collaborative
environment.
