General Assembly offers Web Development Immersive class in 8 cities around the
world. Unlike other bootcamps, GA's curriculum spends some time focusing on CS
topics like runtimes of algorithms and data structures. This is great for
students who've learned a lot of syntax on their own, but need to get more
knowledge of best practices in computing.

They also provide job preparation from reviewing portfolios to verbal
programming quizzes. Additionally, after the end of the course, they host a
meet and greet with potential employers and also open applications to the GA
apprenticeship program. The program is
basically a 12 week paid apprenticeship with a tech company.

To apply to the program, you first fill out an application online. You will
then have an informational and fit phone interview. Afterwords, you will need
to complete pre-work and have another interview. This interview will be more
around skills including the pre-work and logic problems. This process might
vary based on which city you plan on applying to.
