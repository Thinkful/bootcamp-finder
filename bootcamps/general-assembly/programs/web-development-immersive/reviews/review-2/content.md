I’m really enjoying the WDI program. So far this seems like a really effective
way for me to learn. I think back to my undergraduate days when I struggled
through an Intro to Java course and now I can see what went wrong for me; it’s
just really hard to learn how to program in a seminar class of ~150-200
students. And my professor didn’t care if we did or did not learn. The only
real downside to participating in this WDI program is that I’m exhausted. I
feel like I’m in a dream-like state all the time. In the early hours of the
morning when I’m in my REM sleep stage, I dream about trying to access values
inside hashes. As I was sleeping in on Saturday morning, my husband was
putting away laundry and he tried to ask me where he should put one of my
pairs of shorts. I replied, “They’re just instance variables.” That’s not
normal.  It’s definitely worth it though. I’ve already learned so much in just
one week! The instructional team is all sorts of encouraging and they’re
always reminding us that we’re each on our own timeline for learning all of
this. No matter how many roadblocks I may hit on this path, I am resolved to
maintain an optimistic disposition. It’ll take plenty of time and practice,
but it will be amazing once I can easily and logically break a complex problem
down into manageable bits. I’m becoming addicted to that feeling you get when
your code does what you want it to do. I really look forward to thinking like
a developer. - Christine
