I could see the hunger for knowledge in my classmates eyes and it was
inspiring and motivating. Every one was fully immersed into the coursework and
hung on to every word from our instructor. The first two days has been a
review for most of us but there were a couple of things that we brushed up on
in HTML and CSS. Tomorrow we will learn how to structure our content with box
modeling. Jonathan Grover has been an amazing teacher. He has extensive front
end experience and his teaching style has been engaging and made the 6 hour
class go by very quickly. Our TA’s Brian Dear and Andre Jordan has been very
helpful. They float around the classroom helping us troubleshoot our code and
answer any questions that we may have. The energy in the classroom was quite
surprising. There is a lot of pressure for us to succeed in six short weeks
and all of the veterans are taking it head on. I don’t even know why I am
surprised. I mean, we are veterans after all. Working in a high-pressured
environment with sky high expectations is what we do best. - Richard
