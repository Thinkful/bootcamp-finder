IÂ´ve been involved in digital products for years (VP of product in 2 start
ups) and felt like I needed technical knowledge to become a better
professional and a better entrepreneur.

  

After the Ironhack I am now capable of:

i. digging into a complex RoR application, understanding the way its back-end
works and being able to contribute code myself solving tickets in the pipeline
ii. building from scratch a RoR application using best practices iii. having a
better understanding on how several digital technologies are created, the way
they evolve, grow and interact with each other

  

Ironhack excels in several ways:

i. Great teachers. There was consensus within alumni that 9 out of 10 teachers
were simply outstanding. ii. Great materials. Most of the alumni will be using
materials from the Ironhack as a guide and as a repository of knowledge to
come back to from time to time for review. iii. Great student selection
process. An adequate mix of backgrounds, including technical profiles,
entrepreneurs and technology corporations engineers has created a rich
environment which contributed to both a great leaning process and an
unforgettable networking and bonding experience.

  

I met my main goal, which was to improve in all product related aspects of a
digital product start up, from product ownership to pipeline planning or
technical hires.

  

But most importantly, I now feel capable of building a digital product, a
process which I am passionate about, challenging, addictive and enjoyable at
the same time. - Tabi V
