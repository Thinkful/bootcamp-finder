  

As an "old school" programmer I did the Ironhack bootcamp to improve my skills
and do things the modern right way (TDD, design patterns, clean code, ect..)
so that I could land a better paying job at a company that I liked. The
process was not easy at allI because you have to work hard during the course
and make a lot of sacrifices like skipping family time, but it’s for a short
period and the results make it worth it.

  

Now I’m done, I’m 1000% satisfied with the results. I reached my goals and
beyond. I found a much better job, and enjoy what I every day and how I do it.
Due to my new skill set I’m also receiving at least 2 leads per week for new
work opportunities.

  

But the journey was as valuable as my outcome! Imagine sharing knowledge and
experiences with people with who your share interests and goals. A top notch
student body coupled with a great program, the best teachers and an invaluable
team supporting you, sets the right environment for a super fast paced
learning environment.

  

The personal connections that we made were great as well. I stay in touch with
most of the students and teachers months after having finalized my course.

  

For future students I would say: be prepared to do your best and for a better
reward that you could imagine. The harder you work then more you get back
after the course. [\- Jaime M.](http://jaimemmp.com)
