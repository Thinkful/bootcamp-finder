During Ironhackâ€™s web development bootcamp, recruits will learn all about
Ruby, Git, Rails, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No previous experience is
necessary, as all students must remotely complete 60 hours of prep work before
coming to the Ironhack campus. Students will participate in mock interviews,
meet potential employers, and show off their skills in coding challenges and a
demo day.
