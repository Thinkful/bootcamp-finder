Before coming to campus for Ironhackâ€™s iOS development bootcamp, students will
learn the fundamentals (remotely!) through 60 hours of online prep work. Once
on campus, bootcampers will be immersed in coding and debugging. In the final
weeks of the program, soon-to-be graduates will deploy their apps in the App
Store as well as meet potential employers.
