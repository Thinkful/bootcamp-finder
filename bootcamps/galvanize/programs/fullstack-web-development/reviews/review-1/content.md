Jeff has a pretty intense teaching style that works and is effective, but it
is very stressful. What he tends to do is throw you into the deep end by
giving you a project that is way out of your comfort zone. Just when you feel
like you are about to drown he gives you some guidance, advice , kind of like
being handed a floaty whilst drowning. At the end of that crazy experience you
feel exhausted but end up walking away having gained a lot of new skills. -
