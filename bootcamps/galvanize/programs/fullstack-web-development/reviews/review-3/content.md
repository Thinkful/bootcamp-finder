I have been here for one week so far and my experience has been great. I have
done more programming in one week then I thought possible. The rate at which
we are learning new concepts is very fast and the instructors are there to
support us every step of the way. Deciding to join gSchool is by far the best
choice I have ever made. - Adam M.
