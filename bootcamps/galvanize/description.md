Galvanize is a company that invests in startups, hosts tech events in its
space, and helps to educate the tech community. gSchool is a part of
Galvanize's mission to teach tech. It accepts beginners who are passionate
about learning but they do caveat that by saying most of their students have a
college degree and a technical background.

While there isn't really a day to day breakdown of what you will be doing,
expect to spend all day working with instructors learning to code. Outside of
the time you will spend in class, you should also expect an additional 20-30
hours a week of reading and project work.

In order to apply, you should fill out their online application (you need to
sign in to do this...if they aren't accepting applications then the sign in
doesn't work...or generally just doesn't work). It might take up to two weeks
to hear back about your application. If you pass their qualifications, you
will be invited for an hour long in person or video chat. You should expect a
final decision in about a week. Once you get an offer you have one week to
submit a deposit to save your space.
