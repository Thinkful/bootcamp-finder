      \ This course is the heart of the Codeworks system, and is mainly divided in\
      \ two sections. The pre-course (remote, 8 weeks, part-time), and the main course\

      \ JavaScript + HTML + CSS, jQuery, Git, Developer tools, intro to APIs.\n\n\
      For the main course, during the first half you concentrate on theory and advanced\

      \ divided by weeks, is as follows. 1-3) Advanced JavaScript + HTML + CSS, test-driven\
      \ development, data structures, algorithms, complexity analysis, fundamentals\
      \ of other programming languages. 4-5) Back-end frameworks (Node, Express, Koa),\
