After the Startup Instituteâ€™s eight-week web design bootcamp, graduates will
be trained in front-end development, interface design, and user-centered
principles. Startup Institute students will not only have the necessary skill
sets in HTML, CSS, CSS3, and JavaScript, but also career advice and portfolios
to present. The program has locations in New York City, Boston, and Chicago.
