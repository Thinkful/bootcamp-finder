I just finished. It was an intense dive into Ruby, iOS, and Javascript
concepts. There was so much work and so much networking that I made it about
half way through the labs before I had to surrender and just keep working on
my partner project and setup interviews etc. In the end it was worth every
second and every penny and now I have a new job I start in a few days after a
career change. I highly recommend it. I did everything from the learning
mentioned above to learning security, Amazon Web Services, and white boarding
algorithms. I don't feel like Im a great Rails dev yet but that will come with
time. I'm a much more well rounded Dev now than I was prior to. - Joshua A.
