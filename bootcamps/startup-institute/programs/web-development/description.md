Startup Institute’s three campuses – San Francisco, New York, and Chicago –
all provide eligible students with eight-week bootcamps in web development.
The program ends with a Talent Expo, where soon-to-be-graduates literally have
a chance to sell their skills in front of industry hiring professionals. At
least 88% of Startup Institute graduates say they love their new careers a lot
more than their previous jobs.
