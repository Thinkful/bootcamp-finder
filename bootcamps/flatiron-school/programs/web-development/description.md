The Ruby program is a 12 week, full time, intensive program, designed give you
the equivalent skillset and experience of an entry-level Ruby developer.
Because we focus heavily on collaboration, you are required to be on campus
Monday Thru Friday, 9AM-6PM throughout the duration of the program. There is
certainly a fair amount of work to be done beyond those hours (many students
choose to stay late and come in on weekends), but that’s the minimum.

Prior to arriving to campus, you’ll also complete 4 weeks (80-120 hours in
total) of prework assignments at home. This, plus the following 12 weeks of
on-campus learning, amounts to a 16 week commitment.

The Flatiron School prepares students for its web development bootcamp with
150 hours of pre-work, which can be completed remotely before beginning the
intensive. The pre-work prepares even those without any web development
experience to spend their time on campus studying more advanced topics such as
Ruby. The Flatiron School’s web development curriculum also includes plenty of
intensive career counseling and interview training.
