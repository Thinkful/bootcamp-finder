I'm a non-techie looking to increase my knowledge with development frameworks
and languages and have been slowly diving into info sessions and seminars to
focus my studies and to gain a foundational understanding. Avi knows his stuff
and as such, for non-experienced programmers, you should embrace the course to
listen to him explain the theory and concept in which why and how Ruby and
Rails interact within one another. His analogies and metaphors in explaining
the object orientation environment that Ruby on Rails is based upon was
tremendously helpful in me understanding the logic behind the language. In
addition, learning the concept of Gems, essentially pre-built applications
that can plug-into your code for common yet useful operations (please forgive
me if this language isn't technically correct), was very interesting and
increased my excitement to learn the language. I defintely suggest Avi for
non-techies as long as you are willing to use the course only as a starting
point & guide and understand that if you really want to learn the language,
it's going to require sweat in working a tutorial, understanding the syntax,
and getting your hands dirty. - Anonymous
