I had a great experience with Avi's Intro to Ruby course. As someone familiar
with basic programming logic but not much of actual coding, the course was
both educational as well as a solid challenge. Avi's teaching style is that of
a seasoned, enthusiastic practitioner, and his excitement for programming and
teaching shines through in your interactions with him. At least for his multi-
session courses, come to his classes with questions and a willingness to
learn, because the difficulty curve does ramp up and there's a lot of material
crammed in. Avi is great about answering questions as well as providing
resources for his students, including but not limited to class wikis, reading
recommendations, tutoring, and review of his class materials. If you work to
engage what he teaches, you'll have a very rewarding experience. - Nathan G.
