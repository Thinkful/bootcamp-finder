The iOS course is a 12 week, full time, intensive program, designed to give
you the equivalent skillset and experience of an entry-level iOS Objective-C
developer. There is no prior experience necessary. Due to the amount of
material covered and our focus on collaboration, you are required to be on
campus Monday thru Friday, 9AM-6PM throughout the duration of the program.
Outside of class there is plenty of work to be done, but that's the minimum.

Graduates of the Flatiron Schoolâ€™s iOS development bootcamp have landed jobs
at prestigious companies such as The New York Times, Etsy, and Boeing. The on-
campus curriculum includes Git, custom interfaces, and test-driven
development. Flatiron School iOS development students also keep blogs and give
technical presentations at Meetups.
