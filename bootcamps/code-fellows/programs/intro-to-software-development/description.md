In this one-day workshop, you will get a taste of a day in the life of a software developer, with a sneak peek of the Code Fellows learning experience, overview of how websites are built, and hands-on training to code a webpage using industry-standard tools and professional coding practices.

At the end of this workshop, you will know the basics of what it means to be a professional software developer and how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create the modern web. After creating a complete website with a team and hearing from professional software developers in the industry, each participant will walk away knowing what to expect from a career in coding and the Code Fellows program.
