My experience was personally and professionally rewarding and I cannot speak
highly enough of the Makers team and their program. Of course nine months ago
I didn't know any of this. Like many of you I had a million questions and
didn't know if this journey would be right for me. I hope the following helps
answer some of those questions. - Sarah Young
