Makers Academy uses an Agile method of creating their curriculum. Essentially,
the curriculum changes and grows based off of previous sessions. We highly
suggest taking a look at their [ curriculum
breakout](http://www.makersacademy.com/info/curriculum) to get the most
updated course offering. While some material shifts, the topics should largely
remain the same. Like we mentioned before, definitely keep in mind that a
majority of your learning will be done [pair
programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming). In addition to
the pair programming, you should expect to work on various exercises, projects
and have end of the week tests.
