Launch Academy is an immersive coding bootcamp located in Boston. Through the course of 10 weeks, aspiring programmers will graduate to Jr. full stack web-developer status. You will take part in an 8-week interactive pre-learning programming to kickstart your learning before you even set foot on campus. After you have locked down pre-learning, you will then learn the various languages that make up a full stack curriculum including: JavaScript, Ruby, HTML, CSS, SQL, and Git. This gets students to a place where they can jump into exclusively backend and front end jobs or land a job as a jack-of-all-trades in the tech industry. 

In the last few weeks, students will participate in group projects, which are used to simulate the experience of working on a real software team, managed by a senior-level engineer. Launchers complete the program with a workable product and an expanded portfolio they can present to companies at career day, where they network with hiring managers from tech companies all over the country. Launch offers structured postgraduate curriculum and lifetime career support to ensure you land a job that you can feel great about.
