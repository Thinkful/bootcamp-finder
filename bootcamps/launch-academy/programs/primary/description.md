Launch Academy’s 10-week program in Boston prepares graduates for jobs as
junior full-stack developers. The curriculum includes pre-bootcamp work (which
can be completed remotely), extensive job-hunting assistance for six months,
and alumni benefits. Launch Academy’s on-campus experience includes two days
where soon-to-be graduates can show prospective employers what they built
during bootcamp.
