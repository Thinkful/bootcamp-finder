Launch Academy is a very intense and hardcore immersive learning experience.
The pace that myself and everyone was learning was incredible. Coming from a
mostly front-end background, I had some experience in the background but not
enough where I knew how everything tied in together in an application. Launch
Academy has helped me fill those holes in my knowledge and thus increased my
own confidence as a developer. Most of the students had absolutely no web
development or programming background. The fact that the students have a
working deployed app after 10 weeks as well as a plethora of completed coding
challenges and projects says a lot about the efficiency of Launch Academy. -
