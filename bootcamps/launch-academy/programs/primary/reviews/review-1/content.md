When I was deciding whether or not to join Launch Academy I read a tweet from
a company stating that they had just hired a Launch Academy student. After
doing some research, I came to the conclusion that this company looked like
the perfect opportunity for me. About ten weeks later and I got hired by that
exact company. If that doesn't speak to the efficiency of this program, I
don't know what does. Worth it? Yes. Clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose! -
