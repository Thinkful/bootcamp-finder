  * Upon being accepted into a cohort, we'll ask you for a 10% deposit ($800 CAD)
  * We'll ask for the remaining 90% of your tuition 2-4 weeks before your intended start date. This can be paid via wire transfer or cheque
  * We offer financing on a case-by-case basis and can work with you to figure out a solution that works for both parties. Reach out to rahul@lighthouselabs.ca for more details!
