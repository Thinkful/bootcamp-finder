After four weeks of remote preparation work, iOS development bootcampers will
spend at least 50 hours a week in a combination of classroom and lab training
at Lighthouse Labs. The intensive program also includes a lot of weekend
homework, but Lighthouse Labs has a 100% employment rate for its graduates.
Just a few of the companies that have hired bootcamp graduates include
AxiomZen, Retsly, and ShoeMe.ca.
