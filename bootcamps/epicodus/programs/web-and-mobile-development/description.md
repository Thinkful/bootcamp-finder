All Epicodus bootcamp instructors are Epicodus graduates themselves, and offer
their experience and knowledge during a 25-week intensive in Portland, Oregon.
Another unique feature is that within reason, students can design their own
tracks and also complete an internship for bootcamp credit. Popular topics
include Ruby, JavaScript, Rails, Android, and Drupal.
