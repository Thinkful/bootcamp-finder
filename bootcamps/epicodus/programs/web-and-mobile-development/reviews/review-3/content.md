At Epicodus we learn by doing. Our day starts with a 10 minute stand-up where
we share what we’ve learned the day before and talk about any coding issues we
came across or interesting solutions we came up with. We then spend the rest
of the day pair-programming with another classmate. Every day we have a new
project to work on, building on whatever we did the previous day, and on
weekends we do homework to prepare for the upcoming week. I absolutely
recommend Epicodus with one caveat to potential students: spend some time
first seeing what coding is about and making sure that it’s actually something
you want to do. After that, I can’t think of a better way to learn than by
actually coding day in and day out with other aspiring developers and a
knowledgeable instructor to guide you. - Mac E.
