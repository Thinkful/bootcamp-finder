It’s been said that we pursue higher education not for the knowledge we gain
of a specific subject, but to learn how to learn about any subject. It’s the
same for coding at Epicodus: the most valuable skills we learn there teach us
how to teach ourselves. Any programmer stuck on a bug can tell you how useful
a skill it is to quickly and precisely locate information on the error you’re
receiving. Every day, our class pair programs for eight hours, building full-
stack web apps, and integrating new technologies as our projects demand them.
Michael, our instructor, is there for assistance, but class is self-directed.
You quickly learn whether you enjoy programming full-time. - Braden O.
