Other programs/bootcamps typically run 9-12 weeks. Epicodus is 17! Because of
this weâ€™re able to learn more languages, tools (like Git) and really develop
good coding habits (like test-driven development). I feel this makes us much
more appealing candidates for developer positions because our foothold in the
fundamentals is so strong. - Hunter M.
