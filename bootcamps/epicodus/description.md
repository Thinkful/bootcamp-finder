Epicodus, a mostly Ruby on Rails bootcamp, is serious about applicants
demonstrating teamwork and having tried programming before attending. They are
the core components of their application and the reason why is apparent
throughout their curriculum. Like many other bootcamps, they prefer that you
have tried to learn to code before. They want to make sure that you know what
you are getting into. They think it's in your best interest and we agree!

Each week students should expect to spend some time (they say about 20-40 min)
on the weekend watching videos from a curriculum created by Epicodus. These
videos introduce the concepts that you will be using in the upcoming week. 

Aside from this video curriculum, you should expect to spend all of your in-
class time pair programming.
Well, aside from a 5-10 minute stand up at the beginning of each day to
discuss any insights from the past day. While this may seem inconsequential,
many development teams use this tactic to kick off a day of work on a project
and its great to get in the habit as a beginner.

Perhaps the most interesting part of the Epicodus bootcamp is the Epicodus
Internship and the reason they stress teamwork. For the last month of the
program, Epicodus teams up with clients to provide the real experience of
developing an application for a client. While not always true, Epicodus
prefers that the projects are open source (great because you will be able to
show off the code to future employers), for a good cause (great for the soul),
and local clients (great because you will experience working with a client
face to face).
