The Iron Yardâ€™s back-end engineering with C# and .NET bootcamp empowers
students to build websites and apps that function similar to Amazon, Facebook,
and Twitter. The curriculum includes programming fundamentals such as data
modeling, as well as front-end tools. Mock interviews, resume writing, on-site
tours with development teams, and guest speakers are also part of The Iron
Yard bootcamp experience.
