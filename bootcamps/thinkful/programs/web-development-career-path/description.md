Career Path combines an in-depth, project-based approach with three 1-on-1
sessions every week. This program is built to land beginners their first
developer job without having to quit their existing one like all offline
programs. In this fully online program you'll work side-by-side with a
professional developer building interactive websites and apps. Your mentor
will customize each phase of the course, so you can learn other JavaScript
frameworks and build advanced capstone projects from scratch. You'll also gain
valuable real-world experience working in a team setting as you collaborate
with other students over GitHub and Slack.
