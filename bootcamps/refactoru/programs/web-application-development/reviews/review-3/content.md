I now work for a company called Human Design here in Boulder, CO and couldn't
be happier! RefactorU was an amazing experience and I learned everything I
needed to a successful web developer. After working in the industry I've
always wanted to work in, I know I'll always consider this to be my best
decision. If you never take the leap to change your life, you'll never get to
where you want to be. - Rob C.
