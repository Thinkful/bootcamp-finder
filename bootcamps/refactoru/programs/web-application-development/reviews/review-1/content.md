For my first job, I got hired to build an enterprise-ready version of an
application that I did as part of my coursework at RefactorU. In my interview
I was able to show them a functional application that proved I had experience
working on relevant, cutting-edge technologies: Node/Express, Sockets, and
MongoDB. That just shows how relevant our training in Boulder was. -
