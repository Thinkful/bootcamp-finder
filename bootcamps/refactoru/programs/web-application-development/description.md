RefactorU, with its campus in Boulder, Colorado, offers a 10-week fullstack
JavaScript boot camp. The experience mimics a 40-50 hour a week full-time job
as much as possible. Refactor U graduates are prepared for careers as entry-
level web application developers, and have found jobs at a number of companies
including IBM and Best Buy.
