Peaks Academy is a part-time, 24-week intensive experience that will turn you into a job-ready candidate. Our goal is to create an online classroom that replicates in-person bootcamps, but it is available to people who want to study while keeping their current job. Online instruction will provide academic theory and practical explanations, while assignments and projects will replicate the day-to-day work of data analysts and scientists. Students will use real data to build a two-project portfolio to present to potential employers. Upon graduating, students will have completed rigorous training in machine learning, programming in Python, data wrangling, project design, and communication of results.
