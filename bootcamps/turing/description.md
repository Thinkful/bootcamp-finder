Turing is not a bootcamp. It is a seven-month, full-time training program to
turn driven students into professional developers. Turing is the brainchild of
Jeff Casimir and Jumpstart Lab (you might recognize these names from Hungry
Academy and gSchool, among other achievements). Students participate in the
program full time with 40 hours a week of class and lab time and an additional
20-30 hours a week spent on homework. The program is divided into four six
week modules with an intermission week between each module in order to allow
students to absorb and process the knowledge they gain during the course of
each module.

The staff at Turing emphasizes their educational experience, not just their
years as developers, and promises that successful graduates of the school will
be valuable contributors to the company they choose to work for. The Turing
curriculum is deep and grounded in solid pedagogy. The instructors are all
experienced classroom teachers who care about the future of their students.

The application process is rolling, and requires a resume, writing sample,
video response, and logic challenge. Students in the Turing program will learn
TDD with Ruby, Ruby Web Applications with Sinatra & Rails, Professional Web
Applications, and High-Performance Applications with APIs and Services.
