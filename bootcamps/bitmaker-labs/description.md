Bitmaker Labs is a Ruby on Rails bootcamp that teaches you how to code by
recreating some of the most popular web applications on the Internet. You
should expect to be challenged in class, but you will also have a mandatory
pre-work program to complete before you arrive which should help you out.

Applying is easily done on-line. When submitting your online application you
will be prompted to schedule an in-person interview or a Skype call.
