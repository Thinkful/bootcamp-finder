I was in the 3rd cohort and have had a successful and exciting experience
post-bitmaker. I got hired by a great company, but left to pursue my own
business which was actually just a continuation of my final project. Before
applying you must understand that paying money and going through the hoops
placed before you does not in itself impress employers. You must use the
skills learned and your story to convince people of your value. Nobody gets
anything for free, and you still have to hustle. Just yesterday I went to move
a couch, I saw a guy programming in the building lobby and asked what he was
doing. He showed me his site and I told him about mine, and then he offered me
an interview. My point is, Bitmaker is the best way to motivate and accelerate
your desire to learn to code, and should be viewed as such rather than a free
ride to a dream job. The hiring week is a bonus, and can be used to practice
pitching your value proposition and networking. And even still, I know many
people who were hired directly from it, including myself. The best part about
bitmaker is immersing yourself in the tech community, experiencing the
completion of difficult goals amongst like-minded individuals, and sparking
your inner programmer/entrepreneur. In the end, as with all things, it's up to
you where the experience takes you. Happy coding to all who apply, and don't
ever stop giving it your all. - Ryan R.
