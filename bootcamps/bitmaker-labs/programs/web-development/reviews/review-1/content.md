Personally I had a great experience at Bitmakers. I was in the first cohort
and I learnt a great deal about creating web applications with Rails. I was
lucky when graduating I had a few job opportunities spring up. Overall, its up
to the student to learn. The bitmaker program provides opportunities and
supports learning but the student needs to commit time, energy and absolute
focus. - Thomas B.
