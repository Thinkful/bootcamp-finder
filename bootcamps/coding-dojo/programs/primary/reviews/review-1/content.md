The basis of the Coding Dojo learning environment is very simple. If you were
to learn these things on your own you would spend 80% of your time learning
how to get started, researching the right content, making sure it wasn’t
outdated. Only 20% of your time would actually be spend learning what you’ve
researched. I understand this concept, because I have been teaching myself for
the past 2 1/2 years. At Coding Dojo they take the research variable out of
the equation and provide you only with information and the tools you need to
learn. They do however, want you to struggle on your own before asking
questions. When you struggle for a little bit and finally see how it is
supposed to be done, you understand it that much better. Another element that
is provided here is a benchmark. Learning things on your own does not give you
the ability to benchmark your progress. At the bootcamp our coding is reviewed
to make sure we are grasping the concepts correctly. This prevents you from
continuing bad habits. When I was told that I was going to learn several
different coding languages in such short period of time. I honestly didn’t
believe it, but after understanding the logic behind the “Coding Dojo Way” I
wholeheartedly believe that I will have no problem learning all of the
languages. - Randall F.
