The networking that happens here is invaluable. Thanks to early alumni
connection the area, Coding Dojo has informal alumni support in the 500
Startups accelerator and fundraiser community. You can possibly get your
pitches polished. I had mine polished by a friend right before the demo day.
At one point, a Y Combinator alum also consulted for Coding Dojo. I had
personally received contacts, pitching advice, career advice, and job advice
from him. That was helpful too. Sometimes, it's about the way of changing your
career, not necessarily the skill set. - Dilys S.
