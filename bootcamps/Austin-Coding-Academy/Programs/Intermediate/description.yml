In the Intermediate class, you have already developed your chops with HTML and CSS and can build beautiful, responsive websites that any freelancer would drool over. Now itâ€™s time to start building applications to give those pages some life. In the intermediate class, you will attend class two nights a week, and outside of class, do approximately 2 hours a day of homework. You will learn Object Oriented Programming, server calls, API integration, and build multiple web applications all in 10 weeks.
