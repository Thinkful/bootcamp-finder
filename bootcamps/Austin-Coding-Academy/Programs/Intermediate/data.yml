reviews:
- Austin Coding Academy was a phenomenal experience for me. I had a little experience in web design and coding, so I knew I would enjoy it, but classes at ACA really pushed that passion forward. Instructors and staff are really driven and so obviously love what they do – they all go the extra mile to make sure you are getting everything you can out of class. ACA really strives to make their environment community-oriented, which allowed me to learn from classmates and even make great friends! I’m astonished at the amount of knowledge I gained in three short months and would recommend ACA to anyone I know.
- I was reluctant to attend an immersive course but I wasn’t making much progress on my own. I found ACA’s flexible option and decided to take the leap. I can honestly say that it was the best investment I’ve made. From the very beginning, what set ACA apart (and what made me stay) is their open door policy and attention to each student. They are always looking for ways to improve the school based on feedback from the students. They are also building an amazing community full of inspiring and supportive people. I have made friends, gained confidence and found a sweet job thanks to ACA.
