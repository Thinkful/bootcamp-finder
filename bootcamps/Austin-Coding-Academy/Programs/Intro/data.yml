reviews:
- I love Austin Coding Academy and can not say enough good things about them! ACA not only teaches you Full-Stack Web Development, but also provides you with crucial skills to aide you in finding a job upon (or even before) graduation. Everyone involved with this school is passionate about learning and is completely invested in helping all the students succeed. I was able to build a fantastic network of people not only from the teachers, but from other students as well. Hands down, there is not another coding bootcamp out there where you get this much bang for your buck.
- I just completed the entire Full Stack curriculum at Austin Coding Academy and not only did they help me transition my career into coding, they helped me land a JavaScript Engineering job before I even graduated. The instructors are ‘wicked smart’, the curriculum is challenging in a good way, and the community is incredibly supportive. I recommend anyone looking to upgrade their skill set or a complete career change to look no further than ACA for the most affordable and flexible option available.
- The Intro course was a great kickstarter for my education in Coding. I wouldn’t have been able to motivate myself without the help of the amazing teachers and staff of ACA. Everyone down to the owners are very involved in your education and are more than willing to help you understand anything you may be struggling with.
