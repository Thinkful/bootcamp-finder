reviews:
- I come from a Finance background and I have never worked in IT before. In the past I have always had problems learning how to code but ACA helped me connect the dots. I researched many schools in the Austin area before choosing the Austin Coding Academy. The reason I chose them was because they offered the best quality at an exceptional price. Choosing to attend the Austin Coding Academy has proven to be one of the best decisions I have ever made.
- Challenging classes lead by an incredible team! As a (previously) non-technical person it was very very rewarding to learn coding in a way that suited my schedule and pace of learning. The structure and pace of their classes are great and enable you to really choose how and what youâ€™d like to learn. The ACA team is comprised of professionals full of great resources for students to take advantage of. Highly recommend for those wanting to up their skill set or change careers all together.
