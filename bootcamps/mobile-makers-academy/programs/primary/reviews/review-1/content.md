If you go work at a start-up or a dev shop, you’re working as a team, which
includes designers and business development. Working on a team for three weeks
is actual, real-life work experience that we’re getting in the classroom, and
that’s something that universities totally miss. I felt lost when I graduated
from college, but this program helps a lot. - Yash
