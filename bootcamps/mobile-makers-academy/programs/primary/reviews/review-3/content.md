Thanks to Mobile Maker’s former Chief Learning Architect Adam Lupu, the Mobile
Makers teaching approach was phenomenal. I can’t believe how much and how fast
I learned! The great lectures combined with constant practice of the concepts
building on each other was very effective. Both instructors, Don Bora, the
founder of Mobile Makers and EightBitStudios, and Keith Alperin, founder of
Helium Foot Software, have years of experience and were phenomenal teachers
with an incredible amount of patience explaining what must be very basic
concepts to them! Also, since there were only 16 students at Mobile Makers
(although two dropped out toward the end), it felt like you got a lot of
personal attention when you had questions and needed something explained.
However, this stuff is really really hard and you only have 8 weeks at Mobile
Makers. So, as I’ve said before with Dev Bootcamp and similar Code Schools,
don’t come unprepared with 0 coding experience. If you’re struggling to get
the basics, you won’t get as much out of the course. It’s definitely
impressive what my peers with no previous coding experience have accomplished,
but, again, they had the hardest time and seemed discouraged when they were
falling behind. If you know at least some coding basics, you will do really
well in the course. I recommend taking at least Stanford’s CS106A and knowing
the Big Nerd Ranch Objective-C book INSIDE and OUT! - Natasha M.
