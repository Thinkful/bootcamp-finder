Like its name suggests, this bootcamp is all about building mobile apps for
iOS. No, seriously, they say that within the first 5 weeks you will have built
at least 25 small iPhone apps. Don't panic, before you even show up, you will
complete more than 30 hours of pre-work material to prepare you for this task.
The other weeks of the program are dedicated to building a bigger app on a
team. You get to pitch and vote on app ideas, so the projects themselves
should be engaging. You will also learn about development technique like
agile software development and QA during those three weeks.
The bootcamp ends with a Meet the Makers Open House where your apps are shown
off.

As for the day to day, you should expect to spend Monday through Thursday
morning learning in class and then the afternoon and evenings working on
Challenges to develop the skills you learn. On Friday, you basically recap and
review the past week. They also offer a Weekend Hack which makes the Challenge
from that week more complex.

Applying is easy, fill out the online application and if they are interested,
they will follow up to schedule and in-person or virtual interview. A few
things to note, you need to have a Mac and you should have an Apple mobile
device as well.
