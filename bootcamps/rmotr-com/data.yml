    description: "RMOTR's Web Development with Django course is great for Python developers that are willing\
      \ to get a job as Web developers or want to create their our products/startups. You will start with a quick\
      \ overview of all the Django concepts, and jump directly into the most advanced features of the framework.\
      \ We dedicate a big part of the course to teach you about HTTP concepts, MVC frameworks and RESTful architectures.\
      \ You will be writing an entire RESTful API using the well know 'django-rest-framework' library.\
      \ The program aims to teach you things that you won't find in most of the common resources, like: good practices\
      \ based on experience, conventions, most used tools, building reusable Django apps and uploading them to pypi,\
      \ deploying your Django app or API, etc.\n"
