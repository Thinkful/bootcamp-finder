App Academy has done a great job of interlacing computer science knowledge
with the practical skill you need to be a web developer. You can see this
throughout their curriculum but also in the way they teach. They believe in
real world learning so 90% of your time will be working on labs with a
partner.

Expect to go through a more rigorous interview process to get in to this
bootcamp. First you will submit your application and receive a coding
challenge within 2 days of submission. Depending on how that goes, you might
be asked to answer a second coding problem. Then you will be asked to have an
interview. Expect to answer coding questions during the interview. They will
get back to you within two days of the interview with a final decision. They
provide resources for beginning programmers to learn how to approach these
problems, but take your time! They are considered the most important parts of
your application.
