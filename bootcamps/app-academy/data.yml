  science knowledge

  with the practical skill you need to be a web developer. You can see this

  throughout their curriculum but also in the way they teach. They believe in

  real world learning so 90% of your time will be working on labs with a

  partner.


  Expect to go through a more rigorous interview process to get in to this

  bootcamp. First you will submit your application and receive a coding

  challenge within 2 days of submission. Depending on how that goes, you might

  be asked to answer a second coding problem. Then you will be asked to have an

  interview. Expect to answer coding questions during the interview. They will

  get back to you within two days of the interview with a final decision. They

  provide resources for beginning programmers to learn how to approach these

  problems, but take your time! They are considered the most important parts of

  your application.
