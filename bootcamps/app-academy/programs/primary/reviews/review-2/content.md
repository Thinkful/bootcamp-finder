  

Despite my new found love of programming, I wasn’t at all convinced that I
could find a job as a programmer.  I was self taught, only had 2 years of
experience, and Ohio isn’t exactly brimming with developer opportunities in
the same way that San Francisco is.  So when my brother forwarded me an email
about the App Academy, I was ready to sign up…Since the end of App Academy,
I’ve been asked a number of times what advice I can give on how to improve
one’s chances during the application process.  My answer is to show them what
they’re looking for.  Show them that you are capable of thinking like a
programmer and that you’re willing to work hard at it.  Show them that you
understand the amazing opportunity that the App Academy presents and that
you’re willing to treat it as such…During class we always worked in pairs.
We’d switch every day or two.  And each time we switched, we’d start a new
project.  Each app we created taught us a new design principle or framework.
