I have a master's in computer networks and have been working as an enterprise
software developer for a little over 2 years. Web/mobile app development was a
field that had always interested me, but I had absolutely no experience. This
is where App Academy comes in. To be completely honest, I was skeptical about
the whole concept, being in the first cycle and all, but it was reason enough
for me to quit my job. On the first day of the program, however, I realized
that I had nothing to worry about. As we did introductions, I found that
people had come to App Academy from all around the world! I realized all these
people had put their lives on hold to pursue exactly what I was pursuing. You
could feel the energy and excitement. I could tell this was going to be a
great experience. Ned and Kush are awesome. Kush is well versed in Ruby and
Rails. Ned is a great teacher and a skilled developer with deep knowledge of
Rails and app development. Ned has no issues explaining complex topics and in
the rare event that he's stumped by a question, he will make sure to come back
to you when he has the solution. He's always available for questions and gives
extra lectures outside of regular hours to make sure everyone is up to speed.
The learning is fast but not unreasonable. I have never learned this much
development in such a condensed period of time. I have classmates who have
never touched code before this program, that can put together substantial apps
after just 5 weeks. - an App Academy Student
